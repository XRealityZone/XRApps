    "description": "Use Reality Composer Pro to compose, edit, and preview RealityKit content for your visionOS app. In your Reality Composer Pro project, you can create one or more scenes, each of which contains a hierarchy of virtual objects called entities that your app can efficiently load and display.\nIn addition to helping you compose entity hierarchies, Reality Composer Pro also gives you the ability to add and configure components — even custom components that you’ve written — to the entities in your scenes.\nYou can also design the visual appearance of entities using Shader Graph, a node-based visual tool for creating RealityKit materials. Shader Graph gives you a tremendous amount of control over the surface details and shape of entities. You can even create animated materials and dynamic materials that change based on the state of your app or user input.\nDiorama demonstrates many of RealityKit and Reality Composer Pro’s features. It displays an interactive, virtual topographical trail map, much like the real-world dioramas you find at trailheads and ranger stations in national parks. This virtual map has points of interest you can tap to bring up more detailed information. You can also smoothly transition between two trail maps: Yosemite and Catalina Island.",
